# Personal Karabiner Elements Configuration

This is my personal Karabiner-Elements configuration.
Vim based keybindings with function key for the most part.

## Current Version

Long and short press of the function key is used to switch between layers.

### Layer 1

- `f` key as function layer to start layer 1 (vim based keybindings with some custom keybindings)

### Layer 2

- `2` key as number layer to start layer 2 (number pad keybindings)
- spacebar, n, m, comma, j, k, l, u, i, o as number pad keys
- `n` : period, `h`: comma

### Layer 3

- `3` key as Mouse layer to start layer 3 (mouse keybindings)
- move: w, a, s, d
- c: left click, r: right click
- q: scroll up, e: scroll down
- z: scroll left, x: scroll right
